# Image Classification Platform  

This repository contains the implementation of a versatile image classification platform that integrates two powerful deep learning models: MobileNetV2 and a custom-trained CIFAR-10 model. Designed for both practical and educational use, the platform provides real-time predictions with confidence scores through an intuitive web interface built using Streamlit.

## Features  

1. **Dual-Model Integration**  
   - **MobileNetV2**: A general-purpose model capable of classifying 1,000 categories from the ImageNet dataset.  
   - **CIFAR-10 Model**: Specializes in classifying images into ten predefined categories such as airplanes, automobiles, birds, etc.  

2. **User-Friendly Interface**  
   - Image upload functionality.  
   - Model selection via a navigation bar.  
   - Real-time classification results with confidence scores.  

3. **Educational Value**  
   - Provides insights into the workings of deep learning models.  
   - Demonstrates the differences in performance between a general-purpose model and a domain-specific model.
